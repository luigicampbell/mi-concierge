# mi-concierge

Whenever a customer visits a restaurant or hotel the staff ask the same questions, do you have any food allergies, do you like a high or low floor, what would you like to drink, etc. Why don't these business know you preferences ahead of time. Even if they do keep profiles for you they do not share them with other businesses causing multiple static profiles to be built.
 
My Concierge comes to the rescue. Customers register their preferences across hotels, restaurants, airlines, ride services, etc. and then shares their profile with the business. When you show up they know your preferences and you get better more customized service.
 
Additionally, as your preferences change, you like new drinks, change your seat preferences or music taste the business can be given the right to update your profile so the next business will get a refreshed view.
 
Business can also scan their customer profile (without name or email) to understand what types of services and products customers are asking for that they may not offer further enhancing the customer experience and better reflecting ever changing needs of customers.
